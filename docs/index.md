# Welcome to the AI Training Dataset Sustainability Toolkit
## Guidance to the Toolkit

The purpose of this toolkit is to support Lacuna Fund grantees and researchers in publishing sustainable AI training datasets in standard formats. The toolkit is designed as a step-by-step playbook, guidance and checklist that researchers can reference as they prepare their datasets to ensure widespread reuse by other researchers in the Machine Learning (ML) community.  The toolkit covers topics including guidance on producing high-quality datasets before publication, selection of appropriate platforms to host the dataset, and activities they can undertake to promote the datasets and maximize their discoverability and impact. The toolkit will also emphasize ethical considerations including guidelines on how to protect personal information and privacy.

Examples provided within this initial draft of the toolkit are specific to datasets for use in ML in Agriculture, Climate, Natural Language Processing, Health and Energy. 

We welcome feedback on these guidelines by contacting Leonida at [leo@developlocal.org](mailto:leo@developlocal.org)  or Cecilia at [cecilia@developlocal.org](mailto:cecilia@developlocal.org).
